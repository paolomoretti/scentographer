    <p>Scentographers is Paolo Moretti and Sara Xiayu and it is an attempt to record and archive scents.</p>
    <p>Odours are chemical molecules and they are detected when they touch our olfactory epithelium (a small patch of
      tissue at the back of our noses).</p>
    <p>They are so much more than that though: they can almost be psychic triggers to re-evoking past experiences. When
      scents are detected, our brain can instantly evoke emotions and feelings that belong to specific memories.</p>
    <p>Sadly, tools to store odours and play them back are yet to exist.</p>

    <p>Scentographers is our own personal device to store and play memories of scents.</p>
    <p>Each scent is stored and reproduced as a digital video.</p>
    <p>All images are shot where the scent is sensed, then processed, filtered and edited in a video according to the scent cues.</p>
    <p>All sounds are field-recorded in real time during the photo-shooting; sound samples are then used as an ambient generator, filtered through resonators, delays and other effects according to the scent features.</p>
