      Sense of smell has always had quite an impact on our memories. <br>
      Whether a unique scent of a person or an odor connected to a particular place or situation, smell is something kept and recorded deep inside each of us.
      <br>
      And unlike sight and hearing, thereâ€™s no tool to play it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scentographers is an attempt to play, record and store memories of odor in digital videos.
    </p>
    <p>
      All images are taken where smells are sensed, then processed and edited suiting the smell feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audio is field-recorded during the photo shooting process in real time. <br>
      Every sample is used as an ambient generator, filtered and played with resonators to recreate the specific and unique feeling the odor has.
      <br>
      No extraneous audio samples are used in order to keep a faithful representation.
