    memories: `Our noses were permeated by the incense burnt in Koyasan settlement; we were almost wrapped by a resinous and woody layer that insulated and sealed a hieratic experience.
That felt like some sort of holy initiation to prime our nose to the intense benzene smell we sensed  on a boat tour around Yokohama’s port. The pungent odour from hydrocarbons, antifreeze, lots of different chemical compounds and, of course, benzene, had a suppressing effect that buzzed with our indulgence.`,

    memories: `Sulphur was surrounding and permeating our days: the geothermal water we drank and had showers under, the hot springs we soaked in, our own towels and clothes absorbing it from our skin. As if the volcanic rocks and soil we were stepping on were infiltrating our nose and brain with a violent, decomposing yet sublime and transcendent odour.`

    memories: `Wandering through the marvels and terrors of a XIX century amusement park, trails of popcorn scent were blown by the sea breeze leading the way to fairy tales, pirates and gargantuan dinosaurs. Sweet and salty and burnt and ludicrous and grotesque and bewildering.`

    memories: `We walked miles and miles of silvery, balsamic and intoxicating eucalyptus fragrance. We stood still in secret and secluded byzantine churches, immersed in the airless, earthy and poignant odour of mould crying down their frescoed walls.`,
