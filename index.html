            <p><span>Sense of smell has always had quite an impact on our memories. <br/>
Whether a unique scent of a person or an odor connected to a particular place or situation, smell is something kept and recorded deep inside each of us.<br/>
And unlike sight and hearing, thereâ€™s no tool to play it back.<br/><br/>
Scentographers is an attempt to play, record and store memories of odor in digital videos.<br/><br/>
All images are taken where smells are sensed, then processed and edited suiting the smell feeling.<br/><br/>
Audio is field-recorded during the photo shooting process in real time.<br/>
Every sample is used as an ambient generator, filtered and played with resonators to recreate the specific and unique feeling the odor has.<br/>
No extraneous audio samples are used in order to keep a faithful representation.</span></p>
