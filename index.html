            <p><span>Sense of smell has always had quite an impact on our memories. <br/>
Whether a unique scent of a person or an odor connected to a particular place or situation, smell is something kept and recorded deep inside each of us.<br/>
And unlike sight and hearing, thereâ€™s no tool to play it back.<br/><br/>
Scentographers is an attempt to play, record and store memories of odor in digital videos.<br/><br/>
All images are taken where smells are sensed, then processed and edited suiting the smell feeling.<br/><br/>
Audio is field-recorded during the photo shooting process in real time.<br/>
Every sample is used as an ambient generator, filtered and played with resonators to recreate the specific and unique feeling the odor has.<br/>
No extraneous audio samples are used in order to keep a faithful representation.</span></p>

            <p><span>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</span></p>
